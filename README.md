# Discord-Bot
Python based discord bot I am currently working on to help improve the discord server I use with my friends on a daily basis. 
Currently trying to implement a fantasy sports league style bot.

Currently the Discord Bot can read specific text in the discord server and when the correct text is read, the bot will output specific text or pull text from an API,
like the inspirational quote command.

There is also a Level and experience sytem that has been implemented to track who uses the server the most. In the future I would like to do things with the expirence
like sell emojis, or place wagers like the current system seen on Twitch.tv.
